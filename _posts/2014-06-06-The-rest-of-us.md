title: The Rest Of MMXIV
---

June 6th, leaving only and almost half a year for MMXIV.

People do all things hastily, with no awareness of 'where I am' or 'who you are'. So sad, isn't it? No self-regard, let alone others.

You suffer inattention, you never score a simple goal, you grow restless by your restlessness. And finally surrender to the lost yourself.

Someone say, you want something, you fight for it; You want something, you follow your heart;

You need to do much to save yourself.

Short life, long road.

For the past years in your life, you may feel confused, though never find a way to change it. You worked for your needs, others' or other's goal. But now, please find a way home.

Find yourself a clear goal, and comes a better tomorrow!

* Stop all silly thinkings!
* Meditation -> Introspection
* If you find it better, Loop!

Simple, right? Don't fail at it again! I am looking at you! Good night!
